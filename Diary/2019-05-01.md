### Parsing keyword arguments

Useful Elisp technique for parsing keyword arguments:

```lisp
;; What's the element after ":bar"?
(let ((kwargs '(:foo 1 :bar 2)))
  (second (memq :bar kwargs))) ;; 2
```

- `memq` seeks _element_ and returns sublist starting at _element_ or `nil` if _element_ does not belong to list.
- `second` (which could be `cadr` or `(car (cdr ...))`), returns the element right after _element_.

A more advanced snippet can be found in `cl--parsing-keywords`, used to parse
the `cl-keys` variable inside `cl-seq.el` functions.

```lisp
;; cl--parsing-keywords is used inside functions, so it requires
;; a cl-keys variable in scope.
(setq cl-keys '(:foo 1 :bar 2))
(macroexpand '(cl--parsing-keywords (:bar :foo) ()))
```

The above macro expands to the following:

```lisp
;; 1. Grab the specified keywords (corresponding to first macro argument)
;;    off cl-keys and make their values available inside `let`.
(let* ((cl-bar (car (cdr (memq :bar cl-keys))))
       (cl-foo (car (cdr (memq :foo cl-keys)))))
  ;; Now let's validate the arguments!
  ;;
  ;; 2. Copy `cl-keys` to `cl-keys-temp`, to be used/mutated inside the loop.
  (let ((cl-keys-temp cl-keys))
    ;; 3. Go over each kwarg
    (while cl-keys-temp
          ;; Short-circuit style validation
          ;;
          ;; 4. Grab the first arg from `cl-keys` with `car`.
          ;;    Does it belong to the set of keywords we specified?
          ;;    If it returns a list the answer is yes, so bail out...
          ;;    otherwise, evaluate the next condition.
      (or (memq (car cl-keys-temp) '(:bar :foo))
          ;; 5. Is `allow-other-keys` set? If so, forgive unknown arg.
          (car (cdr (memq :allow-other-keys cl-keys)))
          ;; 6. Bad kwarg!
          (error "Bad keyword argument %s" (car cl-keys-temp)))
      ;; 7. Update `cl-keys-temp` by discarding the current kwarg's value
      ;;    and loop back over.
      (setq cl-keys-temp (cdr (cdr cl-keys-temp)))))
  nil)
```

### The weird difference between delete and remove

Common Lisp has both `delete` and `remove`. The latter is a pure
function, while the former performs destructive delete. But... it
won't ever destroy the first element!

```lisp
(setf a (list 1 2))
(delete 2 a) ;; (1)
a ;; (1)

(delete 1 a) ;; NIL (empty list)
a ;; still (1), WTF?
```

I was left wondering why the first element can't be deleted, so I
tried to figure it out on my own. Then I googled and found
[this](http://www.lispforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=4678), which
confirmed my suspicion and explained things further.

So why is that? Behind the curtains, `delete` works with `setcdr` to
mutate the original list, thereby setting the `cdr` of cons cells
along the chain. The `a` variable points at the first cons, which is
`(1 . sublist)`. If we were to destructively delete the first element,
we'd have to _replace_ the `a` reference with an empty list because
the first element can't be reached with `cdr`. And what if we do the
following?

```lisp
(defparameter a '(1))
(rplaca a nil) ;; (nil)
```

It won't _delete_ the element, it will replace it with `nil`. A cons
cell has to have a pair of elements. Even when it seems to have one,
it has two: `(1)` is `(1 . nil)`. An empty list isn't even a cons:

```lisp
(consp '(1)) ;; t
(consp '()) ;; nil
(consp nil) ;; nil
```

Therefore, deleting the first element hits a special case, and regards
a limitation about the way cons cells work in Common Lisp and Emacs
Lisp. **We can't delete the `car` of a cons cell!** Neither can we
delete the `cdr`! All we can do is replace it with `nil` to signal end
of list.

However, when we do this:

```lisp
(defparameter a '(1))
(pop a) ;; ()
a ;; ()
```

It empties the list! WTF? Well, that's probably the reason why
`pop` is a macro:

```lisp
* (macroexpand '(pop a))
;; (LET ((#:G416 (CAR A)))
;;   (SETQ A (CDR A))
;;   #:G416)
```

It does `(setq a (cdr a))` to pop off the first element. The `pop` macro
takes a symbol at compile time, thus being able to do this very
thing.

#### What's the point of `delete`?

If `delete` is not guaranteed to mutate the first element _off_ the
list, what's the point of using it? Well, it won't generate a new
list, which would give additional work to the garbage collector.

This _memory optimization_ was particularly important in the 80's, and
it's still important when dealing with big lists.

#### How to use delete (and remove)

Always change the variable:

```lisp
(setq a (delete 1 a))
```

This would be the obvious thing to do with `remove`, since it's a pure
function:

```lisp
(setf a (remove 1 a))
```

But it's also required with `delete`.

#### Practical lessons learned

- Don't use `delete` unless dealing with reasonably big lists.
- Always `setf` with both `delete` and `remove`.
