## 2019-04-25 - Lisp

Dissecting Land of Lisp functions modified by me to be more functional.

```lisp
(defun direct-edges (node edge-list)
  (remove-if-not (lambda (x) (eql (car x) node))
                 edge-list))

(defun get-connected (node edge-list)
  "Given an EDGE-LIST of (node1 . node2), where node1 and node2 are
integers, returns a list of connected nodes starting from NODE.
Keeps track of a 'visited' list that is passed down to
the recursive calls. Therefore, the final returned value is the
'visited' list.

Why is the stop condition (if (member node visited) ...)?
Well, suppose you call:

;; Blows up the call stack
(get-connected 1 (list (cons 1 2) (cons 2 3) (cons 3 1)))

Toward the end, the 'visited' list would equal (1 2 3)
but then the function would find 1 as the cdr of (3 . 1)
and would go back to where it all started - which would
enter an infinite loop and blow up the call stack. Just because
the graph can be cyclic.

If we replace the whole stop condition with the else branch, the
code would work only for EDGE-LIST with non-circular references.
For instance:

(get-connected 1 (list (cons 1 2) (cons 2 3))) ;; Returns (3 2 1)

Therefore, the stop condition is not exactly what it seems.
It is an '*edge case* stop condition', or second stop condition
if you might. The primary stop condition is hit when reaching the
leaf nodes."
  (labels ((traverse (node visited)
             (if (member node visited)
                 visited
                 (let ((visited (push node visited)))
                   (reduce (lambda (v edge) (traverse (cdr edge) v))
                           (direct-edges node edge-list)
                           :initial-value visited)))))
    (traverse node (list))))
```

If this function were just:

```lisp
(defun get-connected (node edge-list)
  (labels ((traverse (node visited)
                     (let ((visited (push node visited)))
                       (reduce (lambda (v edge) (traverse (cdr edge) v))
                               (direct-edges node edge-list)
                               :initial-value visited))))
    (traverse node (list))))
```

It would enter an infinite loop if the input were an edge list
representing a cyclic graph. Common Lisp has tail
call optimization, so the following function would never cause
a stack overflow:

```lisp
(defun foo () (foo))
```

But the alternative version of `get-connected` would. Why? It turns
out the recursive call, which happens inside a lambda, is not
at tail position. It's the same case as this nonsense function:

```lisp
(defun bar ()
  (mapcar (lambda (x) (* x (bar))) '(1 2 3)))
```
