## 2019-05-02 - Lisp and ELisp

Let's carry on with explorations of `delete` and `remove`. Refer to
the [last
entry](https://github.com/thiagoa/notes/blob/master/Diary/2019-05-01.md)
for more context.

### Deleting elements from the end of the sequence

A few options can change the behavior of both `delete` and `remove`.
For instance:

```lisp
(defparameter a '(6 6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6))
(remove 6 a :from-end t :count 5) ;; (6 3 3 3)
```

We've removed 6 elements, starting from the end of the sequence. Of
course, `:from-end` is only effective with a `:count`, otherwise it
makes no sense.

Without `:from-end`, it deletes from the start of the sequence:

```lisp
(remove 6 a :count 5) ;; (3 3 3 6)
```

However, things are different in Elisp: `:from-end` will only apply if
`:count` is smaller than half the length of the sequence. I suspect
this is due to performance, as `:from-end` is expensive and
requires repeatedly seeking the position of _element_.

```lisp
(setq a '(6 6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6)) ;; Length 9
(cl-remove 6 a :from-end t :count 5) ;; (3 3 3 6)
```

As we can see, the above result is equal to the upper CL expression,
`(remove 6 a :count 5)`, which _does not specify_ `:from-end`.
`from-end` was therefore ignored.

If we decrease `:count` to 3 (less than half of sequence length, 3
< 4), we get the expected result:

```lisp
(setq a '(6 6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6)) ;; Length 9
(cl-remove 6 a :from-end t :count 3) ;; (6 6 6 3 3 3)
```

### Bounded index designators

With `:start` and `:end`, so called bounded index designators, we can
specify the range for delete to act on:

```lisp
(setq a '(6 6 6 3 3 3 6 6 6))
(cl-remove 6 a :start 2 :end 7) ;; (6 6 3 3 3 6 6)
```

The `:start` -> `:end` range _excludes_ the end value, therefore
`:end` needs to be 7 in this example, and not 6 as one would expect.

These options can be mixed and matched with others to achieve the
desired result.

### Again: we can't rely on `delete` to perform mutations

Another example where `delete` doesn't perform mutation:

```lisp
(defparameter a '(1 1 1 2 2 2 3))
(cl-delete 1 a)
a ;; Still (1 1 1 2 2 2 3)
```

If _target_ is repeated sequentially, multiple times _at the head of
list_, there'll be no mutations within that area. If _target_ is present
anywhere else though, there'll be mutations:

```lisp
(defparameter a '(1 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 1))
(cl-delete 1 a)
a ;; (1 1 1 2 2 2 3)
```

### Dissecting cl-delete

Having myself a functional-addicted mind, sometimes I feel my imperative
skills getting weak. Here I take the source code if `cl-delete`
from `cl-seq.el` and annotate it:

```lisp
(defun cl-delete (cl-item cl-seq &rest cl-keys)
  ;; Parse `cl-keys` and make "cl-" prefixed variables available inside the method body.
  ;; `:count` will be parsed as `cl-count`, `:if` as `cl-if`, etc.
  (cl--parsing-keywords (:test :test-not :key :if :if-not :count :from-end
                               (:start 0) :end) ()
    (let ((len (length cl-seq)))
      ;; If `cl-count` is specified and less than 0, there's nothing to
      ;; do... just return the list and bail out. This expression will
      ;; also confusingly set the default value of `cl-count` to the
      ;; length of the list.
      (if (<= (or cl-count (setq cl-count len)) 0)
          cl-seq
        ;; Super basic check... is cl-seq a list?
        (if (listp cl-seq)
            ;; Is `cl-from-end` set, and is `cl-count` less than half the
            ;; length of the list?
            (if (and cl-from-end (< cl-count (/ len 2)))
                ;; START CL-FROM-END PARSING
                (let (cl-i)
                  ;; Decrease `cl-count` and look for the position
                  ;; of `cl-item` at the tail end of the
                  ;; list (assigned to `cl-i`). If `cl-count` is less
                  ;; than 0 or `cl-item` can't be found within the bounded
                  ;; index designators (`cl-start` to `cl-end`), stop the
                  ;; loop.
                  (while (and (>= (setq cl-count (1- cl-count)) 0)
                              ;; NOTE: `cl--position` relies on dynamic scoping
                              ;; (i.e., is coupled to) with variables such as `cl-if`,
                              ;; `cl-test`, etc.
                              (setq cl-i (cl--position cl-item cl-seq cl-start
                                                       cl-end cl-from-end)))
                    ;; If `cl-i` is 0, an optimization can be applied:
                    ;; simply pop the first element off. Note that we
                    ;; are not mutating the list with `setcdr` because
                    ;; we can't mutate the first element (refer to

                    (if (= cl-i 0)
                        (setq cl-seq (cdr cl-seq))
                      ;; Otherwise, grab the `nthcdr` relative to
                      ;; `cl-i` and mutate it with `setcdr` by
                      ;; popping the first element off as well.
                      (let ((cl-tail (nthcdr (1- cl-i) cl-seq)))
                        (setcdr cl-tail (cdr (cdr cl-tail)))))
                    ;; Update `cl-end` (bounded index
                    ;; designator) to `cl-i`, which makes sense

                  cl-seq)
              ;; END CL-FROM-END PARSING

              ;; From here on it's the else condition, i.e., when
