- `\e` to edit the last PG command line. How to edit a previous command line without executing it again?

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION myrand(range INTEGER)
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
  null_in INTEGER := random() * range;
BEGIN
  IF null_in = 0 THEN
    RETURN 0;
  ELSIF range % null_in = 0 THEN
    RETURN NULL;
  ELSE
    RETURN random() * range;
  END IF;
END; $$
LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.area_measures (
    measured_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
    area_id bigint,
    acpr numeric,
    ah1 numeric,
    ap1 numeric,
    at1 numeric
);

CREATE INDEX area_measures_measured_at_idx ON public.area_measures USING btree (measured_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX index_area_measures_on_area_id ON public.area_measures USING btree (area_id);
```

### Cost calculation

Reference: http://morningcoffee.io/the-postgresql-query-cost-model.html

A page in PG consists of 8kb. Given that our table contains `select
pg_relation_size('area_measures')` = `8519680`, the number of pages
should be `8519680 / 8192 = 1040 pages`.

`SHOW seq_page_cost` returns `1`, therefore the cost to read these
pages from disk is `1040 * 1 = 1040`.

Adding to this, there is also the cost to send the tuples (rows) to
the CPU. `SHOW cpu_tuple_cost` returns `0.01`, so the total cost is
`number_of_records * cpu_tuple_cost`. We have 100001 records, so that
value will be: `100001 * 0.01 = 1000.01 cost`.

Adding to this, there is the cost to apply the filters. `SHOW
cpu_operator_cost` returns `0.0025`, so the total cost is
`number_of_records * cpu_operator_cost`, `100001 * 0.0025 = 250.0025
cost`

The total cost for a sequential scan will be the sum of these 3 sums:
`2290.0125`
