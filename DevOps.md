- Three ways of DevOps
    - Systems Thinking
	- Feedback Loops
	- Culture of Experimentation
- Principle of Kaizen: continuous improvement
- CAMS model: Culture, automation, measurement, sharing
    - Sharing
	  - For visibility: what you did
	  - Get feedback early
	  - Transparency: why you did it, avoid doing the wrong thing
	  - Knowledge transfer: daily standup, retrospectives, documentation, brown bags, tech talks, internal conferences, chatops (watch someone do a deploy, look at the history)
